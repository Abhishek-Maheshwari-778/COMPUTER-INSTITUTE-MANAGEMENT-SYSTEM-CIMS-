## 🧠 Introduction

The **Computer Institute Management System (CIMS)** is a real-world inspired software project developed as a **CBSE Class 12 Practical Submission**.

It simulates a basic **student enrollment system** used in local computer coaching institutes for managing registrations, editing records, and tracking course enrollments — built entirely using **Python (Procedural Programming)** and **MySQL**.

This project reflects how core programming concepts can be transformed into a working solution — and was my first real step into software development.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The main goal of this project was to:
- Apply **Python and MySQL skills** in a real-world context  
- Build a functional, menu-driven system with clear logic  
- Learn how to **connect frontend (CLI) with backend (database)**  
- Experience the **software development life cycle (SDLC)** end-to-end  
- Solve a practical problem that a small coaching center may face

✅ **Edit Enrollment** – Update student name or course  
✅ **Delete Record** – Admin-only deletion of entries  
✅ **View Enrollments** – List all registered students  
✅ **Secure CLI Menu** – Neatly designed command-line interface  
✅ **Persistent Storage** using MySQL
